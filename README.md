# Shrimp-WSD-Detection-Using-CNN-LSTM
 This repository implements an automated system for detecting White Spot Disease (WSD) in shrimp aquaculture using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It preprocesses imbalanced datasets and achieves 89.5% test accuracy. The project aims to improve early detection, reduce losses, and provide scalable, real-time predictions for aquaculture management.
